            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But theſe men when they are in their greateſt diſſolution, then they raile against religion, which should bridle, and reſtraine them from their rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and wanton exceſſe. This partie being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by a certaine Catholike gentleman, that was at the boorde, began preſently to defend his liberty, and licentiouſnes by holy ſcripture, and by the wordes of our Sauiour mistaken &amp; ill applied, anſwered, that whatſoeuer enteretd into the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doth no harme to the ſoule, but that which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the harte. This is noe newe practiſe in

the malignant Church, as Euſebius ſaith of the Heretike Cerinthus, who becauſe he was giuen to the bellye and beastly pleaſures, framed holy ſcripture accordinge to his ſenſualitie, as this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant alleadged Scripture against fastinge, and began to prouoke the Gentleman to diſpute with him; who anſwered him, that it was not his part to reaſon or iudge of holy Scripture, being ſoe myſticall, and ſo far exceedinge his capacity, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in ſuch diſordered places amoungeſt the cuppes; the fruite whereof would rather tende to confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then to edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante replyed, that if any man could anſweare to his demaundes or questions at the full, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him truly and effectually, he would become Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike: the Gentleman ſaid he would doe his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to propounde ſuch demaundes to others; and ſoe he went vnto the cheefeſt proteſtants of that place, who haue ſett downe theſe challenges &amp; deliuered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the ſaid gent. who deliuered them vnto me; beinge in one houſe with him.</p>

               </note> for they denie all groundes of diſputation; all traditions of the Apostles, Doctors, Councells, and teſtimonie of holy Martyres. For as when S. Augustine, and the holy Doctors of the Church, reaſoned with the Donatists, Arrians, Maniches, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and vrged them with the aucthoritie of godes Church, with the iudgmente of the ſea A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolique, with the ſucceſsion of Bishoppes in the ſame, with the Councells, and finallie with the name Catholike, thoſe heretikes quite reiected all thoſe groundes and meanes of tryall: euen ſo Luther the captaine and ringleader of theſe late heretiques ſaid. I ſet not by a thouſande Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, and a thouſand Cyprians alleadged against me alone: calling S. Augustine, S. Hierom and S. Gregorie, the Iuſtices af the Papiſticall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Thus alſo did that proud Beza, charge O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigines with blaſphemie, adding that neither S. Chryſoſtome, nor any of the Greeke fathers, did euer declare the trueth ſimply: &amp; charged Saint Hierom with shamles errors, as inuocation of Saincts, and the practiſe of chastitie or virginitie in the Church. Muſculus alſo ſaid, that S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom did deſerue rather hell then heauen. Brentius did charge the firſt Councell of Nice with foule er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. Caluine called the fathers thereof Lunatick and francticke people. Muſculus ſaith, they were instigated and led by the diuill, and that all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncells were pernitiouſlie fallen into errors. Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus Regius ſaid, that in the beſt tymes of the Church, Sathan ouerruled all Bushoppes. Peter
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16081:7"/>
Martyr called the aunciente Fathers, pratlers, but no diuines. Illiricus reiected the ſaid Fathers. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Martyr alſo ſaid, that as longe as men relie v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Fathers, they muſt be deluded with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. Doctour Humfrie at Oxford ſaid, that Iuell gaue a great ſcope vnto the Papiſts, and did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe greate wronge, in alleadginge the Fathers for himſelfe: for what haue we to doe with fleash &amp; and bloud? The ſame alſo Caluine and Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr wrote. Whitakers alſo vnto Doctour Sanders anſwered ſayinge. We care not for your hiſtories. Doctour Toby Mathewe ſaid to Father Campion. If he should beleue the Fathers, he could not be a proteſtante. Beza cried out againſt Athanaſius, and the Fathers of the Councell of Nice, for that (ſaith the) Athanaſius found out this Tripartite god (he meant the bleſſed Trinte.)

            <p n="4">4.

For in our daies it changed her religion 4. times within 30. yeares: vnder kinge Henry the 8. kinge Edward his ſonne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Queene Marie; and Elizabeth; And as Fox ſaith, kinge Edward beinge a childe after his fathers funerall, by the inſtigation and ſettinge on of his Vncle the Duke of Somerſett, did abolish the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which his Father had by lawe ordained viz. The ſix articles, containing. 1. The trueth of the Reale preſence. 2. That both kindes for all perſons, are not neceſſarie. 3. That marriage of Priests is prohibited by the lawe of God. 4.

Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording whereunto our Sauiour alſoe ſaith, that heauen and earthe shal paſſe, but my wordes shal not paſse, nor any iott, nor ſillable thereof till al be fulfilled. Is there any Chriſtian to be found, who dares be ſo bould to ſay that our Parlament exceedeth the power of God? But god by his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power (as Aristotle and all diuines, and Philoſophers affirme) cannot make two contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories or contraries to be trewe, becauſe of the implication therein (for if the one be trewe, the other muſt be falſe) and truly noe more can theſe oppoſite and contradictorie Parleaments, be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiblie true.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The 4. cauſe was, that Proteſtantes make but a mockery of all religion, for that they follow Nicholas Machauailes precepts, holding that the Catholike religion is a hinderance to state, and that Princes shoulde followe that religion (though the groundes thereof be neuer ſoe falſe) which doth aduance their preſent eſtate: but contrarie to this S. Thomas ſaith, that wiſdome and power are companions of trewe religion, which when it fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, the power of state alſoe faileth: <hi>non veniat anima mea,</hi> ſaith S. Bernard, <hi>in Concilium e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum qui dicunt &amp;c.</hi> my ſoule shall not follow their Councells who ſay, that the exaltation and and peace of the Empire, will hunder the peace of the Church. If Iuſtice be a vertue to giue euerie man his owne, to giue to Ceſar his owne, and to God his owne, how doth the Prince keepe Iuſtice
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16081:9"/>
with god, that takes from God his righte, which is religion, &amp; depriues his diuine maieſtie of that worshipp &amp; reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which is due vnto him? This is proued, for that Princes followinge this falſe reaſon of state, haue beene put by God fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſtate, as Ieroboam the ſeruant of Salamon, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewe himſelfe in the kingdome which he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from Roboam, did alter the Religion &amp; made a falſe religion. For he made two golden calues, one at Dan, and the other at Bethell: and alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the order of priestoode, by ordaininge others that were not of the order of Leuie. For which both he and his yſſue were depriued of their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and destroied of their liues. The Princes of the Iewes, by reaſon of their ſtate, put Chriſt to death, least the Romaines shoulde come vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neuertheleſſe the Romaines came vpon them, and deſtroyed them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Vetiza a kinge of Spaine and his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor Rodorigus, fearinge the rebellion of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, for their owne wicked actes, destroied and raſed downe all the stronge holdes of Spaine: which was the cauſe that, that Country was broughte in one quarter of a yeare in ſubiection by the Moores, which were not expelled Spaine in 700. yeares after. The kinges of Fraunce, Francis the firſt, and his ſonne Henry the ſecond, the one brought in the Turcke, thinckinge to bringe him in to Spaine againſt Charles the fift Emperour &amp; kinge of Spaine, to deſtroy Spaine. But whether did the tempest driue the Turcke, but to Tolouſe within France, which afterwards with great a

Kinge Henry the third of Fraunce, beinge perſwaded, that he should neuer be obeyed of his ſubiectes, vnles he should make away the Catholique Princes, as Henry of Loren Duke of Guiſe and Luyes of Iore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Cardinall his brother: murthered them in the aſſembly of Bloys 1588. but for that he was led rather by the wicked Councell of Macheuillians, and not by the lawe of God, he was punished himſelfe by a poore ſillye friar without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curment of any, but of his owne head, who thruſt him thorough with a knife beinge in the middest of his army, purpoſing to beſidge Paris. Iohn Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericke Duke of Saxonie, intendinge to take the Empire from the houſe of Austria, followed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Luthers Councell, that he should change his religion, ſoe that by the procurment of Luther he rebelled against his ſoueraigne. But the frute that he reaped by this falſe reaſon, was to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, put in to priſon, depriued of his estate, Dukedome and dignity of elector shipp: was not Abſolon destroyed by the falſe Councell of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofell? And Aman by his wicked plottes, by which he tought to destroie Mardocheus and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of Iſraell? For there is noe wiſdome or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell

of Macheuillians against God &amp; his Church. Thomas Cromwel was put to death (as Fox ſaith) by the cruell lawe he made himſelfe, as by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fatall destinie (theſe be Foxes wordes) that whoſoeuer should be cast into the Tower, he should be put to death without examination; the ſaid Fox calleth this Cromwell the wall and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe of protestant religion. But, <hi>qui hominibus placent confuſi ſunt, quoniam Deus ſpreuit nos,</hi> thoſe which doe pleaſe men are confounded, for God deſpiſeth them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The principal and laſt reaſon or cauſe is, for that theſe articles are already condemned by the generall Iudgement and verdit in ſoe many generall Councells as haue beene in the world, &amp; ſpecially by the last generall Councell of Trent, therfore nowe they ought not to be called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. Whereupon Gelaſius the Pope ſaith. <hi>Maio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res noſtri diuina inſpiratione cernentes, &amp;c.</hi> Our Ancestours foreſeinge by diuine inſpiration, did most earnestly pray the faithfull, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was decreed by any Councell against anny hereſie, for the faith of the Catholiks and the Catholike trueth, it should neuer be broughte in queſtion againe. Alſo Leo the Pope did deſire the Emperour Marcianus, that there should be noe retractation in any thinge defined by the holy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncell, and ſoe the ſaid Marcianus eſtablished by lawe accordinge to his request, that none should diſpute of the definition of the Councell. The ſaid Leo alſo taught the ſame in his Epiſtle to the Councel of Chalcedon, &amp; to Maximus the Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopp
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16081:11"/>
of Antioch. The ſame is alſo decreede in the Councell of Epheſus, and in the Councell of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon, S. Augustine alſo ſaid, that it is an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent madnes to diſputed against any thinge, that the Catholike church had defined. For our Sauior ſaith, whoſoeuer heareth your, heareth me, and whatſoeuer they will you to doe, that doe yee.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For as much therfore, as theſe hereſies were condemned (as I haue ſaid) by the generall Councell of Trent, vnto whom protestantes refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to come to trye their doctrine (for none euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth the triall of generall Councells, but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes) therfore we ought not to diſpute with them any more. Which alſo rightly agreeth with the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of S. Paul vnto Titus ſaying. A man that is an hereticke after the firſt and ſecond admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, shunne, knowinge that ſuch a one is peruerted. And to Tomothy he ſaith, theſe be they that craftilie enter into houſes, and leade captiue ſilly women, alwaies learninge and neuer attaininge vnto the knowledge of the trueth, but as Iames and Mambris reſiſted Moyſes, ſoe theſe alſo reſist the trueth, men corrupted in minde, reprobate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p n="10">10. Thus he admonished, that we should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of wicked Hereſies, the reaſon of his caueat is, for that Hereſie (as the holy Doctors ſaye) is a certaine miſcheefe of the diuill and a firebrande, that cometh from hell, a peſtilente, corrupt, and poyſoned aier, a cancker that conſumeth the body in which it is norished, a certaine diſeaſe, that doth penetrate the intralles, and doth corrupt and infest the ſoules of Christians: and not only doth kill with her touche as the Viper doth, or with her ſighte as the Baſilike, or with her belching as the dragon, but after all theſe fashions and many more, doth deſtroy, confounde, and caſt away all that approache it, neither is there any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie but to flie, nor any other refuge then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte from ſuch a one, as is intangled with it; no other ſecurity, then to be far from ſuch an infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and contagious miſcheefe, which with the name of Chriſte, destroieth Christ in our hartes,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16081:12"/>
and vnder the pretence of faith, deſtroyeth faith. And S.

               <p n="7">7. This is proued by naturall reaſon as alſo in all ſupernaturall actions, for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by which man doth turne vnto God, is by the acts of faith, hope, and charitie, and a penitent harte, but it ſhould be an implication againſt all reaſon, that a man ſhould beleeue in God, hope, and loue God,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16081:101"/>
and be penitent for offendinge God, and that he ſhould doe nothinge therein, or that when a man doth pennaunce, or loueth God, it ſhould be ſaid he loues not God or doth noe pennaunce: in which wee ſee two contradictories true, which cannot be, for one muſt be falſe when the other is true, for if it be true that a man hath faith, or beleefe in God, therfore the contradictorie is falſe, that man hath no faith, nor doth not beleeue in God: euen as it is falſe that the fire doth burne, and the ſunne giue light, and yet that none of them doth any thinge. For to beleeue, or to hope, or to loue, in man are called vitall, and immanent actions, which cannot be ſupplied by any other cauſe, then by ſuch principles out of which they be produced; but to beleeue, or to loue, are produced out of the two principles of man, I meane vnderſtandinge and will, for it is not the action of God immediatlie, but the action of man of whome immediatlie and next it is produced, for it is not ſaid that any other creature doth loue God, but man when man doth loue God: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt not ſaie, that man belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge, hopinge in God, and louinge God, are not the actions of man when he hath the principles, I meane vnderſtandinge and will out of which they procede.</p>

amoungeſt all; There was vnitie of beleefe, withoute deuiſion of ſects; ſimplicitie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out duplicitie; pietie of religion, without impietie of hereſie; one paſtor, and one flock the execrable and dreadfull blaſphemies and hereſies of this wicked age were not heard of all were called chriſtians, and not Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſtes, nor Apoſtles, nor Lutherans, nor Caluiniſtes, nor Hugonotts, nor Geues, nor Adamitts, nor Anabaptiſtes, nor Papiſtes: children were obedient to their Parents, the ſheepe did acknowledge their Paſtors; the laſciuious and pratlinge woman, was not a Miſtres of the ſcriptures; the pope was not called antechriſte: his authoritie was not called in queſtion; The church was feared and obeied of her ſubiects, againſt which there was noe rebellion, or inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of carnall, filthie, inceſtuous and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Apoſtates; men were of honeſt &amp; ſimple diſpoſition, without contention or debate, touchinge their religion, euerie one referringe himſelfe to the catholick church, whoſe faith and meritts was communicated and diffuſed to al her bleſſed members. They had noe newe ghoſpell, but that which was dictated by the holie ghoaſte, and deliuered by the Apoſtles to the Church, and which the Churche propoſed to the faithfull to beleeue.

But to aunſwere more fullie this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, the catholique churche doth not forbid any one to praye in any tounge he thinkes good priuately to himſelf, although in the publique and comon ſeruice thereof, ſhee would haue the comon languadge to be practiſed &amp; obſerued, to preuent confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of tounges, and corruption both of wordes and ſenſe. And as in the Church of God there is one ſacrifice, one order of ceremonies and adminiſtration of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, ſoe wee haue but one languadge comon to all church men. For if you goe to Spaine or America, or to any other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, you ſhall haue the common languadge by which you may vnderſtand them, and they you.

You ought therfore to conſider, that there is noe liuinge fleſhe without the blood, and whoſoeuer receaueth the bodie, receaues the blood alſoe. Yea Luther him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was of this faith, after his reuolte from the Churche; and for that the Chriſtian people be nowe increaſed, and manie recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues often, and at once, ſoe much wine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſecrated without eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſheddinge: as alſo when in manie countries vnder the North-pole they haue not wine at all, it cannot be without great charges to giue euerie man wine, aſmuch as ſhould ſerue for conſecration: and beſides it would be offenſiue to the poore, if they themſelues ſhould be excluded from the chalice more then the rich. And therfore the Church in regard of Chriſtian charitie, to take away all murmure and occaſion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, hath ordained that all ſhould abſtaine from the challice, when aſwell Chriſte is receaued vnder one kinde, as vnder both kindes, neither in the meane time is Chriſts inſtitution violated; The prieſts therfore
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:16081:148"/>
to whom it was commaunded to doe that which Chriſt hath done in his laſt ſupper, they doe both conſecrate and offer, receaue and take, noe otherwiſe then Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath done, who did conſecrate and offer, receaue and take, and hath giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them alſo to be taken vnder both kindes, and this when the prieſt ſaith Maſſe, &amp; noe otherwiſe, becauſe he muſt expreſlie, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the paſsion of Chriſte, and the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his blood from his bodie in the ſame, and ſoe vnto the prieſtes is ſaid, doe this in remembrance of me.</p>

And although the Sacrament of Chriſt pertaynes to all, yet vnto the prieſtes onlie pertaines the chalice. But the laye people and the Clergie alſo, when they doe not execute their function or ſay Maſſe themſelues, are to receaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kind, beinge therby noe leſſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Chriſt his whole perſon and grace, then if they receaued vnder bothe.

I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that Chriſts example doth not binde vs, but in thoſe thinges wherein he intended to bind vs, for in many thinges which he did in that ſacrament, he did not binde vs, as it is manifeſt, otherwiſe wee ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies celebrate in the toppe of a houſe as he did, and after ſupper, and vpon thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daie, and amoungeſt noe more nor leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> twelue, and they twelue Apoſtles, and alſo a Iudas amoungeſt them, and noe wooman ſhould communicate, for noe wooman was there, wee ought alſoe to take the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bread by benediction ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, as our Sauiour did at that ſupper, vnto which the churche is not bounde. And as in theſe thinges we are not bound to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Chriſt, ſoe that the laitie ſhould receaue vnder both kindes, they are not bound to followe the example of Chriſt, for as the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:16081:149"/>

               <p n="6">6. I aunſwere further that many thinges are inſtituted by Chriſt, which doe not bind vs to accompliſhe them, as matrimonie, holie orders, vowes and votaries, to ſay maſſe, virginitie, and euangelicall councells are inſtituted by Chriſte, and yet wee are not obliged therunto, for it is in euerie mans owne election to marrie, to receaue holie orders, to vowe, to be a virgin: it was alſo inſtituted of God that wyne ſhould be vſed for drinke, and yet wee are not coma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unded to drinke it: it was alſo appointed by God, that the firſt fruictes of wyne ſhould be offred vnto the prieſts for their drinke, yet they were not comaunded to drinke it. Trulie you ſhould followe Chriſt and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him, had yow bene obedient to his church accordinge to the example of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who did ſubmitt himſelfe to his mother, the Sinagoge, and her preceptes. For wee muſt vnderſtand, that ſuch thinges as our Lord hath ordained by himſelfe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be altered in his Church, nor be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed withall, as the morall preceptes, and

The firſt ſtate of the church was feruent: for the Chriſtians in that golden world, were inflamed with an ardent loue and feruent charitie to ſhedd their blood for Chriſt, and in this ſtate, Chriſte was deliuered vnto thoſe faithfull chriſtians vnder both kindes, that drincking the blood of our Lorde, they ſhould moſt cheerfully ſhedd their blood for him, as S.

Neither did he altogether wiſh it ſhould be giuen to euerie one of the laytie, but in time of perſecution to ſhedd their blood for Chriſt. In the ſecond ſtate, the church was zealous, though not ſoe feruente, and ſoe
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:16081:150"/>
Chriſt was giuen vnto the chriſtians vnder one kinde, that is to ſay of bread, which was dipped in blood as may be gathered out of manny fathers and councells. In the third ſtate the church was colde and luke warme, and ſo was Chriſt giuen vnto the laytie vnder one kinde without dipping it into the blood. This the church hath done for good cauſe, beinge taught herein by the holly ghoaſte, which euer followeth the churche, whoſe authoritie is of the ſame force nowe as it was then.</p>

For Chriſt offeringe himſelfe vnto his Father nowe in heauen, &amp; before vpon the Croſſe, cannot be ſaide, that he is a prieſte according the order of Melchiſedec, but rather accordinge to that of Arron. as S.

Paule ſaieth: for beſides that Chriſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a churche, and ordained ſacramentes, he offered two ſacrifices, the one on the croſſe, the other at his laſt ſupper, both of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:16081:164"/>
them but one ſacrifice in ſubſtance, yet differ in forme and manner: by that of the croſſe, Chriſte was a prieſt, but not an eternall prieſt, nor accordinge to Melchiſedech, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that was once only offered, and being bloodie, reſembleth not the vnbloodie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Melchiſedech: but by that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered at his laſt ſupper, for he by his prieſtes offeringe ſtill that ſacrifice in the Maſſe, is a prieſt accordinge to Melchiſedech, whoſe ſacrifice conſiſted of bread and wine. And therfore euen as accordinge to S. Paule, Melchiſedech was a figure of Chriſte accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to his prieſt-hoode, ſo was he a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure accordinge to his ſacrifice, for ſacrifice and prieſt-hoode haue a ſpeciall connexion and relation one with an other, but his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der can not be ſaid to be in a bloodie man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For wee doe not read that euer Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech did offer any bloodie ſacrifice, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this order muſt needes conſiſt in an oblation of an vnbloodlie ſacrifice.

that verie parleame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wherin monaſteries &amp; churches were ſurpriſed, and religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned.

But the catholique religion is alwaies one and the ſelfe ſame, alwaiſe retaineth and holdeth the ſame continwance and vigour of trueth, not in diuerſitie of ſectes, but in ſimplicitie and vnitie of beleefe and profeſsion, without duplicitie or diſparitie, or contradiction of doctrine, or without abſurditie or diſhoneſtie in her maners and cuſtomes: becauſe ſhe hath the holy ghoaſt to aſsiſt and direct her in all trueth, and to protect and to defend her from all errors, misbeleefe, and infidelitie. For not only this new religion is changeable and variable in profeſsion and doctrine, but alſo in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cuſtome and behauiour, for alteration in faith and religion, procureth alſo a great alteration and inconſtancy in mindes, and affections, in life and maners, as wee may knowe by ſuch nations, who when they were catholiques, were mercifull, chaſt, ſober, liberall &amp; temperat: children were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to their parentes, and people faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of their promiſſe.
